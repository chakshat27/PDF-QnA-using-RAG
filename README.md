Hereâ€™s a detailed `README.md` you can use for your GitHub repository for the RAG + LLM Streamlit project:

````markdown
# ðŸ“„ PDF Q/A and General Q/A using RAG + Google Gemini

This is a **Streamlit application** for answering questions from uploaded PDFs using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Google Generative AI**. The app can also answer general questions using the Gemini LLM if no PDFs are uploaded or the uploaded PDFs do not contain relevant information.

---

## Features

- Upload one or multiple PDF files and ask questions related to their content.
- Automatically extract text from PDFs and create a **vector store** for efficient retrieval.
- Generate embeddings using **GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings**.
- Use **FAISS** for storing and retrieving embeddings.
- Combine PDF-based Q/A with a general-purpose **Gemini LLM** to answer questions beyond the uploaded documents.
- Display source documents for transparency and context.

---

## Demo

The app interface includes:

1. **File uploader** to upload PDFs.
2. **Query input** to type your question.
3. **Answer output** along with expandable sources for PDF-based answers.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-qa-rag.git
cd pdf-qa-rag
````

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your **Streamlit secrets** for Google API key:

Create a file `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
[general]
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_api_key_here"
```

---

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

1. Upload one or more PDFs (optional).
2. Enter your question in the text input field.
3. Click **Get Answer**.
4. The app will either:

   * Retrieve answers from PDFs (if content is relevant), or
   * Use the general LLM to answer your query.

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ vectorstore/            # Local storage for FAISS vector stores
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Dependencies

* Python 3.9+
* Streamlit
* PyPDF2
* LangChain
* FAISS
* nest\_asyncio
* GoogleGenerativeAI

---

## How it Works

1. **PDF Upload & Text Extraction:**
   Extract text from each uploaded PDF using `PyPDF2`.

2. **Text Splitting:**
   Split text into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for better embedding and retrieval.

3. **Embeddings & Vector Store:**
   Create embeddings for each chunk using GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings and store in FAISS vector store.

4. **RAG Query:**

   * Use the vector store as a retriever for the question.
   * Generate an answer using the **Gemini LLM** conditioned on the retrieved content.

5. **Fallback to General LLM:**
   If PDFs are missing or contain no relevant info, the app queries the LLM directly.

---

## Notes

* FAISS vector stores are cached locally to avoid recomputing embeddings.
* Small delays (`time.sleep(0.2)`) are added to avoid API rate limits.
* `nest_asyncio` is used to handle async calls in Streamlit.

If you want, I can also **add a visual diagram** of the RAG + LLM workflow and embed it in the README to make it more professional for GitHub. Do you want me to do that?
